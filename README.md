## Design - explain any design choices you made including changes to the visualization after collecting feedback
I wanted to create a graph that showed the changes over time for the loans.  Initially income breakdowns were shown, however this distracted from the clarifty of the loan number over time. 

After several iterations a bar chart was utilized to  more clearly show the changes in loan numbers over time and highlighting the amount of loans given by period.

Color coding has been utilized to show the differnt events in the compnay. A legend hsa been used to inform the reader of the color's meetings.


##Feedback - include all feedback you received from others on your visualization from the first sketch to the final visualization

###Feedback 1 V1: 
"The Y axis label is not formatted well. Make the labels easier to read by putting spaces between the words and increasing the font slightly.

The graphic becomes difficult to view between 2012-2014. Is there a better way to view this? Can you use different colors or make it slightly more transparent or make all of the outlines thicker?

Otherwise it looks good. "

###Feedback 2 V2:
The graph looks good. The total loan number is a little confusing to read on the right axis and could be color coded or put in a separate graph. It does help comprehend the total number of loans taken out each year though and is useful information.

The overall graphic is good; showing the number of loans separated by income bracket per year.

The summary was changed from
